      The Louvre is a national art museum in Paris, France, and one of the most
      famous museums in the world. It is located on the Right Bank of the Seine
      in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward) and home to some of
      the most canonical works of European art, including the Mona Lisa, Venus
      de Milo, and Winged Victory. The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace,
      originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II.
      Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of
      the museum.

      museums of the City of Paris that have been incorporated since 1 January
      2013 in the public corporation Paris Musées. It has been listed since 1975
      as a monument historique by the Ministry of Culture.

    <h3>Bourse de Commerce</h3>

      alt="Bourse de Commerce"
    />
    <p>
      The Bourse de commerce (Commodities Exchange) is a building in Paris,
      originally used as a place to negotiate the trade of grain and other
      commodities, and used to provide services to businesses by the Paris
      Chamber of Commerce during the latter part of the 20th century. It has its
      origins in a circular wheat exchange built in 1763–67, with an open-air
      interior court that was later capped by a wooden dome replaced in 1811
      with a copper one (supported by an iron skeletal structure). In a major
      reconstruction in 1888–89 much of the structure was replaced, although the
      layout remained the same and the dome was retained albeit adding glass and
      a mounted canvas. <br />
      Since 2021, the building has been the Parisian exhibition site of the
      Pinault Collection. The dome of the building is listed as a historical
      monument.

    <h3>Bouillon Chartier</h3>

      alt="Bouillon Chartier"

    <p>
      In 19th-century Paris, new eateries were springing up to serve the city’s
      workers, offering hot meals at modest prices. At the great city market of
      Les Halles, one butcher concocted a beef stew, known in French as a
      “bouillon”, that proved so popular he named his restaurant after the dish.
      In 1896 the concept was expanded by two brothers, Camille and Édouard
      Chartier. Their original vision of a restaurant that offered diners an
      exceptional setting, yet was affordable and open to all, was further
      developed over the years – and its charm remains intact to this day.

    <p>
      In the 18th arrondissement of Paris, a stone’s throw away from the Moulin
      Rouge and Sacré Coeur, a new generation of Bouillon is emerging.
      <br />Launched in 2017, this XXL Brasserie in Pigalle reproduces today’s
      fashionable ambiance of Parisian restaurants inaugurated in the 19th
      century by the butcher Duval.
